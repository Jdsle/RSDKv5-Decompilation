A complete decompilation of Retro Engine v5 and v5Ultimate.

# **SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS OF THE RETRO ENGINE**
We do not own the Retro Engine in any way, shape or form, and this project would not have been possible had they not developed RSDKv5(U) in the first place. Retro Engine is currently owned by [Evening Star](https://eveningstar.studio/); we highly urge you to follow & support their projects if you enjoyed this project of ours!

## **DO NOT USE THIS DECOMPILATION PROJECT AS A MEANS TO PIRATE SONIC MANIA (PLUS) OR ANY OTHER RSDKv5(U) GAMES.**
We do not condone using this project as a means for piracy in any form. This project was made with love and care for the source material and was created for purely educational purposes.

# Additional Tweaks
* Added a built-in mod loader and API allowing to easily create and play mods with features such as save file redirection and XML asset loading, supported by all sub-versions of v5U.
* Added a built-in shader compiler for backends/platforms that support it.
* Added various other backends to windows aside from the usual DirectX 9 backends

## If you are here for Sonic Mania:
You have the option of building RSDKv5 alongside Mania in [the Sonic Mania Decompilation repo](https://github.com/RSDKModding/Sonic-Mania-Decompilation).

# How to Build

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/), a versatile building system that supports many different compilers and platforms. You can download CMake [here](https://cmake.org/download/). **(Make sure to enable the feature to add CMake to the system PATH during the installation if you're on Windows!)**

## Get the source code

In order to clone the repository, you need to install Git, which you can get [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Clone the repo **recursively**, using:
`git clone --recursive --single-branch --branch web https://github.com/Jdsle/RSDKv5-Decompilation`

If you've already cloned the repo, run this command inside of the repository:
```git submodule update --init```

## Getting dependencies

The only dependency that you need is libtheora, which you can find at: https://xiph.org/downloads/. Any other dependency will be handled by Emscripten.

After downloading libtheora, unzip it in `dependencies/all` as 'libtheora'.

## Compiling

Compiling is as simple as typing the following in the root repository directory:
```
emcmake cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config release
```

The resulting build will be located somewhere in `build/` depending on your system.

The following cmake arguments are available when compiling:
- Use these by adding `-D[flag-name]=[value]` to the end of the `emcmake cmake -B build` command. For example, to build with `RETRO_DISABLE_PLUS` set to on, add `-DRETRO_DISABLE_PLUS=on` to the command.

### RSDKv5 flags
- `RETRO_REVISION`: What revision to compile for. Takes an integer, defaults to `3` (RSDKv5U).
- `RETRO_DISABLE_PLUS`: Whether or not to disable the Plus DLC. Takes a boolean (on/off): build with `on` when compiling for distribution. Defaults to `off`.
- `RETRO_MOD_LOADER`: Enables or disables the mod loader. Takes a boolean, defaults to `on`.
- `RETRO_MOD_LOADER_VER`: Manually sets the mod loader version. Takes an integer, defaults to the current latest version.
- `RETRO_SUBSYSTEM`: *Only change this if you know what you're doing.* Changes the subsystem that RSDKv5 will be built for. Defaults to the most standard subsystem for the platform.
